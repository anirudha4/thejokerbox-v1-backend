This is the backend for thejokerbox which is my Final Year project. This is just the v1 for the project. The completed one will be uploaded with all the changes and encryption and decryption.

## Steps to get started

- First create a .env file and put the following variables in it
  
  
    >MONGO_URI = !mongo-uri!

    >AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = !AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY!


    >JWT_SECRET = !JWT_SECRET!
